        <p>There are 16 cards, each are a pair. You must choose the same pairs to WIN the game.</p>
        <p>When you turn over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again.</p>
        <p>There will be a limited amount of time for you to find the cards. </p>
        <p>If you do not match the gards within that given time, you LOSE!</p>
        <p>There is also one catch, if the number of flips is greater than 40 you will lose.</p>
        <p>Choose wisely to win and use you MEMORY to the fullest.</p>
        <p>GOOD LUCK!</p>
